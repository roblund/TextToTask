TextToTask - Integration between Twilio and AgileTask. 

You can use this script to text in a task from your cell phone. You will need a Twilio account (http://www.twilio.com), and an AgileTask account (http://agiletask.me) for this integration to work correctly. Host this script on any hosting provider that supports PHP, and cURL.

Installation: Grab the script. Swap in your cell number, and your AgileTask API key. Then upload the script onto a hosting provider of your choice. Take the URL of the hosted script and paste it into your Twilio account's SMS URL.

Use: Text your task to your Twilio number, and it should show up in your Icebox.
